## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javscript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to do an animated dropdown and navigation bar.
I also learned how to use @keyframes


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css

@keyframes moveRight {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(60px);
  }

  80% {
    transform: translateX(-5px);
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0px);
  }
}
```


### Continued development

I want to focus on learning css animations and responsive layouts

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://codinhood.com/micro/10-dropdown-menu-animations-css-transform) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand css animations and its applications to dropdown menus. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
